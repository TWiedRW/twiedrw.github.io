    "text": "Studies show that people make less accurate judgements when comparing values in a 3D graph than its corresponding 2D graph. However, these studies almost entirely consist of projecting the 3D graphs onto paper or on screens (which are 2D surfaces). The goal of this study is to bring 3D graphs into a 3-dimensional environment via 3D printing.\nThis project is currently ongoing with my advisor, Susan VanderPlas. Preliminary results will be presented at SDSS in 2023, with future integration into experiential learning for an introductory statistics course at UNL."

I highly recommend checking it out!"

Since then, I found quite a few packages that are helpful in my workflow.\njanitor is useful for cleaning variable names and removing empty/constant columns and rows from a dataframe.\nrayshader creates 3D visualizations for both terrain and for ggplot graphics. Rendered plots can then be saved as stl files for printing (the subject of my research!)\nbroom can transform model output into a dataframe with the tidy function, which I find helpful when writing reports when paired with knitr::kable\nGGally has a useful function, ggpairs. When several variables are of interest during the data exploration stage, ggpairs allows for the comparisons for variable combinations"
