## Welcome!

Hello! My name is Tyler and I am a recent Masters graduate from University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
The purpose of this page is to provide a space for my professional skill set in the field of statistics. This will include my own personal collection of projects, as well as CV/Resumes for potential employers.
